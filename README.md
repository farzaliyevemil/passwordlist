## 🧠 Social Engineering Wordlists – CUpp

In addition to static and generated wordlists, this repository highlights tools that generate **personalized password lists** using social engineering data.

👉 Learn how to use CUpp here: [cupp-usage.md](cupp-usage.md)

**CUpp** (Common User Passwords Profiler) is a popular Python tool that asks for basic user information (name, birthday, pet name, favorite color, etc.) and automatically generates a custom wordlist based on possible real-life passwords.

It is widely used in CTFs and pentesting, and famously featured in **Mr. Robot**-style scenarios.
